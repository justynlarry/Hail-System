# Decision Log

Running record of design decisions and the reasoning behind them. Append new
entries at the bottom with a date. Do not rewrite old entries — if a decision is
reversed, add a new entry that supersedes it.

The point of this file is that in six months these choices will look arbitrary
without the reasoning attached.

## 2026-09-01 — Generalize beyond hail from day one

Event type is a column value, not a table name. The schema handles any NWS
report type; only hail is loaded for targeting initially.

**Why:** costs nothing now. Adding wind or wildfire later becomes an `UPDATE` to
`report_types.roof_relevant` rather than a schema migration and a deploy.
Building a hail-only system would be the same work with a ceiling on it.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Three-stage design: free browse, paid pull, human send

Storm browsing queries our own database and costs nothing. RentCast listing
pulls cost money and are user-initiated. Email sends risk sending reputation and
require a human click.

**Why:** the exploratory step — where someone is figuring out what they even
want — happens entirely on free data. Cost is only incurred after a person has
narrowed the scope deliberately. Each stage is narrower than the last.

**Supersedes:** an earlier plan for a nightly automatic RentCast pull.

---

## 2026-09-01 — RentCast pulls are user-initiated, not scheduled

**Why:** RentCast bills against a monthly lookup allowance. A nightly pull buys
listings nobody reads on days when nobody acts, and the listings will have
changed by the time anyone looks anyway. Automatic fetching is only worth it
when data is consumed on the same cadence it is collected. This is not that.

**Cost:** loses a natural "new since last night" watermark. Recovered by storing
`first_seen_at` on the listing row.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Nothing sends email automatically, ever

There is no code path from the nightly ingest to an outbound message.

**Why:** storm data is sometimes wrong or duplicated, and a person glancing at a
list catches things software will not. And if something goes wrong, it cannot go
wrong four hundred times before anyone notices.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Storm reports stored at full lat/lon fidelity, zips derived on read

`iem_data` keeps exact coordinates. Affected zip codes are computed by spatial
query, not stored at write time.

**Why:** the buffer radius is a tuning parameter that will change. Storing
derived zips would mean re-ingesting history every time it does. Keep the finest
granularity received; derive everything coarser on read.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Storm report history is never trimmed

**Why:** ten years of Colorado is 135,856 rows, which is small for Postgres.
Slowness would be a missing index, not row count. Deleting costs the ability to
answer "when did this zip last get hit" and to replay a period at a different
radius.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Properties and Listings are separate tables

`properties` keyed on `rentcast_id`; `listings` keyed on a surrogate
`listing_id` with a natural key of `(rentcast_id, list_date)`.

**Why:** RentCast's `id` is a *property* identifier. A house listed in 2024 and
again in 2026 reuses it. One combined table means a relist silently overwrites
the listing an agent was contacted about — including which agent.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Listing agent fields are duplicated on `listings` alongside `realtor_id`

**Why:** two different facts. `list_agent_*` is a snapshot of what RentCast
reported at listing time. `realtors` is the resolved, current understanding of
that person. An agent changes name, brokerage, and email over time; the listing
must preserve who listed it under what name.

**Do not normalize this away.**

---

## 2026-09-01 — No realtor deduplication beyond exact normalized email

Jen Watson may exist five times under five email addresses. That is acceptable.

**Why:** merging on name similarity risks linking a live agent to a suppressed
one. Over-emailing is a recoverable annoyance; wrongly silencing a working agent
is invisible and permanent. Asymmetric risk, so err toward contact.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Suppression is a separate table keyed on email, not a flag on realtors

**Why:** if Jen exists five times under five emails, marking one realtor row
leaves four sendable. She asked not to be contacted at an *address*. Email
keying also allows suppressing addresses never seen as a realtor — a bounce, a
forwarded complaint, a phone call.

**Enforcement runs at send time against `dnc_list`, in the same transaction as
the send.** Never from the UI, never from a cached list.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Confidence is a tiered label computed at query time, not a stored percentage

Display format: "Moderate — 3 reports, up to 1.25″, 2 spotters".

**Why:** a percentage implies a probability the data does not support. What
would actually be computed is a weighted average of reporter categories. Once a
number is on screen, people treat it as more meaningful than it is. Showing the
inputs lets a human override with judgment.

Query-time because the weighting will change; a stored score goes stale
silently and leaves rows scored under different formulas with no way to tell.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Email wording claims a report, not damage

"Hail of X size was reported in your area" — never "your listing was damaged."

**Why:** accurate description of a public record. Defensible, survives scrutiny,
and requires no certainty score to hold up. The system reports; the agent decides.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Templates are append-only and versioned

To change a template: insert a new row, set `supersedes_id`, deactivate the old.

**Why:** editing in place would make historical sends claim to have used text
that did not exist at the time. The audit trail becomes fiction. Side benefit:
walking `supersedes_id` backward gives the edit history for free.

---

## 2026-09-01 — `send_log` snapshots the recipient email address

**Why:** if an agent changes address and the realtor row is updated, every
historical send would appear to have gone somewhere it did not. General
principle: anything describing a past event stores its own copy of the facts.

---

## 2026-09-01 — `send_log.realtor_id` is deliberately denormalized

Reachable via `match_id → listing_id → realtor_id`, stored directly anyway.

**Why:** the frequency-cap check runs on every send. A two-hop join for a query
that constant is not worth the normalization purity. The write path is
responsible for setting it correctly.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Sending goes through a queue; `queued` is a real status

**Why:** slow warmup requires throttled sending, and a crash mid-batch must not
leave uncertainty about what went out. The row exists before the attempt.

**Consequence:** the frequency cap counts `queued` rows, not just `sent`. A
message in the queue will arrive; if the check ignores it, a large batch
double-sends before the first clears.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Three user roles: viewer, sender, admin

`admin` manages users and nothing else — cannot touch templates, suppression, or
sending.

**Why:** the roles map to the cost stages. Someone who just wants to know where
hail hit does not need authority to spend API calls or sending reputation.
The narrow admin needs enforcing explicitly in code, because "admin"
conventionally means "can do everything."

---

## 2026-09-01 — Existing DNC lists imported before Phase 5

Marked `source = 'legacy import'`, `added_by = 'system'`.

**Why:** a suppression list that arrives after the first send arrived too late.
Distinguishable source keeps imported rows from drowning the bounce and
complaint signal from new suppressions.

---

## 2026-09-01 — No "currently being viewed" state tracking

Double-*sending* is prevented by `send_log` and the frequency cap. Duplicated
*effort* is not tracked.

**Why:** with four users in one office, someone saying "I've got the August 24
hail" out loud works better than software locks, which bring staleness problems.
Showing "last contacted" per row covers the case that actually matters.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Whole-country boundary data, not Colorado-only

**Why:** the spatial index makes national scope free to query. If RBI ever
chases a storm into Wyoming or Nebraska, that is not a data-loading emergency
mid-event.

---

## 2026-09-01 — IP: code retained, RBI licensed

Justyn owns the code. RBI receives the running system deployed on their
hardware, not source. Non-compete limited to roofers in RBI's service area,
defined by named counties with a term limit.

**Why:** the rate is discounted in exchange for reuse rights. Generic components
(storm ingest, buffer-to-zip, send log, suppression) live in a separate repo
from RBI-specific configuration so the legal boundary follows a file boundary.

**Open:** source escrow so RBI is not stranded if Justyn becomes unavailable.
